# <a name="How to Play"></a>How to Play

The game, at its core, is a tower defence game. You play a necromancer who can summon creatures to help you.

Your health bar is at the top of the screen and it slowly ticks down. You can spend some health to summon 3 options:

1. A skeleton to fight for you
2. A grave to slowly regenerate your health over time
3. A skeleton portal that summons fire balls to protect you

As time goes on you will be attacked by enemies that slowly get more powerful with each wave.

The game only ends when you lose all your health.
